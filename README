Cutecom 0.41.1, November 22nd, 2006

Cutecom is a graphical serial terminal, like minicom.
It is aimed mainly at hardware developers or other people
who need a terminal to talk to their devices.
It is free software and distributed under the GNU General
Public License Version 2, which can find in the file COPYING.

It is written using the Qt library by Trolltech (www.trolltech.com).

Cutecom doesn't use the autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool, etc.)
Instead "configure" is simply a wrapper script which calls qmake.
To uninstall cutecom simply delete the file "cutecom" and the file 
"cutecom.desktop" amd your done. The config file is ~/.qt/cutecomrc.

Alternatively CuteCom can be built using CMake (http://www.cmake.org),
you need at least version 2.4.3. 
Enter the source directory and run "cmake ." followed by make and make
install and you're done too.

Currently it is known to run on Linux and FreeBSD, and porting to other systems should be easy.
Everything platformspecific should be in QCPPDialogImpl::setNewOptions().
Distributions welcome :-)

Cutecom is heavily inspired by Bray++ for Windows (http://bray.velenje.cx/avr/terminal/)
