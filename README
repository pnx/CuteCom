Cutecom 0.20.0, March 11th, 2008

Cutecom is a graphical serial terminal, like minicom.
It is aimed mainly at hardware developers or other people
who need a terminal to talk to their devices.
It is free software and distributed under the GNU General
Public License Version 2, which can find in the file COPYING.

It is written using the Qt library by Trolltech (www.trolltech.com).

Cutecom doesn't use the autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool, etc.)
but CMake (http://www.cmake.org), you need at least version 2.4.3. 
Enter the source directory and run "cmake ." followed by make and make
install and you're done. To make sure it can find Qt4, set the PATH so that 
qmake from Qt4 is in the PATH (and comes before qmake from Qt3 in the PATH), 
e.g.: export PATH=/opt/qt4/bin:$PATH; cmake .

To uninstall cutecom simply delete the file "cutecom" and the file 
"cutecom.desktop" amd your done. The config file is ~/.qt/cutecomrc.

Currently it is known to run on Linux and FreeBSD, and porting to other systems should be easy.
Everything platformspecific should be in QCPPDialogImpl::setNewOptions().
Distributions welcome :-)
Now that it uses Qt4 it should also be portable to Windows.

Cutecom is heavily inspired by Bray++ for Windows (http://bray.velenje.cx/avr/terminal/)
