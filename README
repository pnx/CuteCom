Cutecom 0.14.0, July 16th, 2006

Cutecom is a graphical serial terminal, like minicom.
It is aimed mainly at hardware developers or other people
who need a terminal to talk to their devices.
It is free software and distributed under the GNU General
Public License Version 2, which can find in the file COPYING.

It is written using the Qt library by Trolltech (www.trolltech.com).

Cutecom doesn't use the autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool, etc.)
Instead "configure" is simply a wrapper script which calls qmake.
To uninstall cutecom simply delete the file "cutecom" and the file 
"cutecom.desktop" amd your done. The config file is ~/.qt/cutecomrc.

Currently only Linux is supported, but porting should be easy.
Everything platformspecific should be in QCPPDialogImpl::setNewOptions().
Distributions welcome :-)

Cutecom is heavily inspired by Bray++ for Windows (http://bray.velenje.cx/avr/terminal/)
